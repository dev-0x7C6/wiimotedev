1.4.5
	feature: Systemd support


v1.4.4
	fix: fixed CORE BUG that assign 0 id for every wiiremote that is connected first time!
	fix: fixed unacceptable long locking on 1 core platform (this should latency provided by wiimotedev interface!)
	core: many source managment cleanups


v1.4.3
	fix: Fixed CORE BUG that assign 0 id for every wiiremote that is connected first time!


v1.4.2
	code: many bug fixes, wiimotedev-toolkit get major upgrade
	feature: added support for absolute axes in infrared module
	feature: auto update state like battery state every minute
	feature: many improvements in wiimotedev-toolkit
	fix: corrected wrong values for pitch/roll in dbusNunchukAcc
	fix: dbusNunchukGetAccelerometrCalibration now store correct calibration data for nunchuk
	fix: fixed bug that don't report nunchuk/classic signals when wiiremote is connected with equiped nunchuk/classic extension
	fix: fixed dbusWiimoteBatteryLife signal, now it should be emitted.
	fix: fixed dbusWiimoteConnected signal (now it works)
	fix: fixed dbusWiimoteDisconnected signal (now it works)
	fix: fixed dbusWiimoteGetAverageLatency and dbusWiimoteGetCurrentLatency in client side!
	fix: fixed distance parameter in dbusVirtualCursorPosition
	fix: fixed stick buttons for nunchuk extension
	fix: fixed tilt buttons for nunchuk extension
	fix: fixed wrong return type for dbusWiimoteAverageLatency and dbusWiimoteCurrentLatency.
	fix: fixed wrong status in dbusWiimoteGetRumbleStatus.


v1.4.1
	code: some cleanups since 1.4.0, but nothing new
	feature: should work in userspace without adding to group "wiimotedev"
	feature: Store connection settings in /etc/wiimotedev/connections.conf
	fix: Fixed bug that assign same id to every wiiremote device
	fix: Fixed dbusNunchukUnplugged signal
	fix: Fixed dbusVirtualCursorFound, dbusVirtualCursorLost signal
	fix: Fixed installation of wiimotedev-io service
	fix: Fixed location for pid file for wiimotedev-io
	fix: Fixed registration of wiimotedev-io dbus interface
	fix: Fixed some old references in init.d scripts for wiimotedev-io
	fix: Fixed virtual cursor correction when only one infrared point is visible


v1.4.0
	feature: auto calibration (it' using wiiremote accelerometer and sensorbar data to define angle)
	feature: x/y axis translation on the fly (it's using wiiremote angle to translate x/y axis)
	feature: extended X axis area (when two points is lost, algorithm make use of 1 point date in other to extend X axis )
	feature: hot corners
	feature: timeout alghoritm (cut down scrolling when timer hit timeout value, this only will happen when wiiremote lose track of points)
	feature: special AIM algorithm (very useful for fps games)


v1.3.0
	code: improved quality of init.d scripts
	code: improved wiimotedev-client
	feature: added auto-registration feaure
	feature: added init.d script for archlinux
	feature: added powersave mode feature
	feature: fixed various bugs
	feature: integration with other wiimotedev sub-projects


v1.2.0
	code: first public release
	feature: support for streaming wiiremote events by network
	feature: support for local dbus interface (org.wiimotedev.daemon)
	feature: added init.d script for debian, gentoo, slackware, ubuntu
	feature: added to org.wiimotedev.deviceEvents
