connected with equiped nunchuk/classic extension
- Fixed stick buttons for nunchuk extension
- Fixed tilt buttons for nunchuk extension 
- Fixed distance parameter in dbusVirtualCursorPosition
- Fixed dbusWiimoteConnected signal (now it works)

- Corrected wrong values for pitch/roll in dbusNunchukAcc
- dbusNunchukGetAccelerometrCalibration now store correct calibration data for nunchuk
- Fixed dbusWiimoteGetAverageLatency and dbusWiimoteGetCurrentLatency in
client side!
- Fixed wrong return type for dbusWiimoteAverageLatency and 
dbusWiimoteCurrentLatency.
- Fixed dbusWiimoteBatteryLife signal, now it should be emitted.
- Fixed wrong status in dbusWiimoteGetRumbleStatus.

1.4.1
General: 
- some cleanups since 1.4.0, but nothing new
- should work in userspace without adding to group "wiimotedev"

Features:
- Store connection settings in /etc/wiimotedev/connections.conf

Bug-Fixed:
- Fixed dbusVirtualCursorFound, dbusVirtualCursorLost signal
- Fixed dbusNunchukUnplugged signal
- Fixed bug that assign same id to every wiiremote device
- Fixed virtual cursor correction when only one infrared point is visible
- Fixed registration of wiimotedev-io dbus interface
- Fixed installation of wiimotedev-io service
- Fixed location for pid file for wiimotedev-io
- Fixed some old references in init.d scripts for wiimotedev-io

1.4.0
- auto calibration (it' using wiiremote accelerometer and sensorbar data to define angle)
- X/Y axis translation on the fly (it's using wiiremote angle to translate x/y axis)
- extended X axis area (when two points is lost, algorithm make use of 1 point date in other to extend X axis )
- hot corners
- timeout alghoritm (cut down scrolling when timer hit timeout value, this only will happen when wiiremote lose track of points)
- special AIM algorithm (very useful for fps games)

1.3.0 
- added auto-registration feaure
- added powersave mode feature
- added init.d script for archlinux
- improved wiimotedev-client
- improved quality of init.d scripts
- integration with other wiimotedev sub-projects
- fixed various bugs

1.2.0
- First public release
- Support for streaming wiiremote events by network
- Support for local dbus interface (org.wiimotedev.daemon)
- Added init.d script for debian, gentoo, slackware, ubuntu
- Added to org.wiimotedev.deviceEvents
